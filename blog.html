					<h2>Hello World! <span class="dates">Friday, Aug 28 2015</span></h2></div>
<<<<<<< HEAD
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Hello World! This will serve as my personal blog for the time being. I didn't really want to use WordPress, Blogger, or any other external service. I think it would be nice if I can format the blog to my own personalized settings! Also, before I get started, I would like you let you all know that most of my blog posts will be very, very long due to how much I express during my day. I want to put essentially most of my college life here so that I can see how I did in the future. Anyway, onto blogging... </p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So it's approximately 10:40 AM right now, and I'm waiting to go to my RHET105 class. By the way, RHET105 is definitely a class I do NOT look forward going to. I understand that writing is important and very crucial to your career, but I don't think I will be using it too much. Anyway, I met this dude name Jimmy (John? James? Jimbo?). He's another student I know that is in DGS and trying to transfer to Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Oh how little these freshman know about transferring and how difficult it is right now to get in... I say the previous statement with experience. I came to UIUC with interest purely in Computer Science.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Roughly 5:20 PM right now. I'm at State Farm, sitting next to my troll buddy Chris. He's a good friend of mine I met when I initially started to intern at State Farm. I like him, and in fact, he's the person who inspired me to make my own website and learn more about web development. I'm supposed to be learning </p>

					<h2>&lt;Weekend&gt; <span class="dates">Friday, Aug 29 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Hey all. Often I won't finish my blog posts because I have other work to do. It seems a little rude, but I will try my best to post on here as much as I can. Anyway, it's about 3:08 PM. So I woke up today after going out yesterday with the guys. We chilled a little bit at Rahul's place and then we went out to a few parties. It was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed being back with my guys after summer break. However, around 11:30 PM, I received a text from my good friend Shalini. She's one of the most wonderful people I have met and I really enjoy talking to her. I went to her apartment and we talked there for over 2 hours! I realized we have so many things in common with each other, like a lot more than usual! We talked about the bahamas, our high school lives, school, classes, the crazy amount of work we have, and even about our friends and view on our life. It was a lot of fun and I enjoyed being with her. I kept staring at her for the longest time, and I would just really enjoy making eye contact and her smile was awesome (yeah, I'm THAT kind of guy).
					<p class="newBlogParagraph">Anyway, I left around 2:30 AM, took the bus back home, and before going to sleep, I actually made some advancements to the Hyperloop website. I'm in this RSO (Registered Student Organizations) called Illini Hyperloop, and they deal with the hyperloop project <a href="http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop">posted by SpaceX</a>. The website I made is here: <a href="http://illinihyperloop.github.io/">Illini Hyperloop</a>. I'm pretty new at web development right now, so I'm learning as I go. But since it's more of an informational website, I think it was a perfect way for me to strengthen my skills. The background color was gray and the website was still in its early stages. I don't know why, but I always found that gray looks very "clean" and "professional" on a website. Even the early stages of this website was gray and white with black font. So of course, I had a "gray theme" type design. I updated it to make it a bit more blue (since blue is popular everywhere, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc). So now the website has a light blue color (hmm... similar to a different website with huge letters at the top of a person's name...). Anyway, I was so tired at that point I just crashed.</p>
					<p class="newBlogParagraph">Woke up around 12:30 PM. Breath felt nasty (as usual) since I totally forgot to brush my teeth last night (not usual; I'm a hygenic person, contrary to the popular engineer stereotypes). It was late, but whatever. I think I crashed around 3:30 AM? Something like that. I went on my laptop and cellphone to check for any notifications or emails from important people. I was hoping my research professor did not email to me since I was pretty behind on his work. He didn't, so that was good new (for now...). I texted my good friend Sara. Sara was probably my best female friend in high school and I really like to spend time with her. She invited me to lunch at the Ike, so I quickly got ready and rushed to the bus stop. The bus system on the weekends really sucks. Yes, I know bus drivers have a life, but I was there was some other system. Anyway, I was lucky since the bus was coming in about 8 minutes, and it runs once every 30 minutes. I got on the bus and I went to the Ike and found her there. We had lunch there and then I went back to her dorm to see her rommate Minako. She's a really nice person from what she said and I wanted to meet her (Japanese Student, international). Unfortunately, she wasn't there, so I just chilled in Sara's room for a while. We talked here and there, and eventually, she crashed. I was writing this in the mean time, and I was mostly just waiting for her to wake up. She woke up dreaming, and I could tell because she said "It's not a cow, it's a cat." Now Sara is in the Pre-Vet program here, and I guess it made somewhat of some sense. But that was a bit funny, and we both laughed it off. I left once she woke up, and now I'm back in my apartment. </p>
