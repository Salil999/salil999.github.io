				<p class="newBlogParagraph">I'll make this quick since I know you all want to get to the juicy stuff below. My name's Shashank Saxena (if you couldn't tell from the huge letters at the top). I am a student at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign admitted for Computer Engineering. This part of my website is NOT about my work. I won't mention what I've done so far, all my cool achievements, or anything. It's simply my day to day life and my thoughts on it. If you want to see what I have done, you can go to the <a href="index.html">home page</a>. This part is strictly my personal life. I may <i>mention</i> my work, my thoughts on it, but I won't talk about it into too much technical detail.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Also, quick tip: The picture of me on the homepage is a shortcut to this page!</p>

					<h2>Hello World! <span class="dates">Friday, Aug 28 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Hello World! This will serve as my personal "blog" for the time being. I didn't really want to use WordPress, Blogger, or any other external service. I think it would be nice if I can format the blog to my own personalized settings! Also, before I get started, I would like you let you all know that most of my blog posts will be very, very long due to how much I express during my day. I want to put essentially most of my college life here so that I can look back in the future. Anyway, onto blogging... </p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So it's approximately 10:40 AM right now, and I'm waiting to go to my RHET105 class. By the way, RHET105 is definitely a class I do NOT look forward going to. I understand that writing is important and very crucial to your career, but I don't think I will be using it too much. Anyway, I met this dude name Jimmy (John? James? Jimbo?). He's another student I know that is in DGS and trying to transfer to Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Oh how little these freshman know about transferring and how difficult it is right now to get in... I say the previous statement with experience. I came to UIUC with interest purely in Computer Science.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Roughly 5:20 PM right now. I'm at State Farm, sitting next to my troll buddy Chris. He's a good friend of mine I met when I initially started to intern at State Farm. I like him, and in fact, he's the person who inspired me to make my own website and learn more about web development. I'm supposed to be learning NodeJS and I'm have a very, very difficult time doing that!</p>

					<h2>&lt;Weekend&gt; <span class="dates">Friday, Aug 29 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Hey all. Often I won't finish my blog posts because I have other work to do. It seems a little rude, but I will try my best to post on here as much as I can. Anyway, it's about 3:08 PM. So I woke up today after going out yesterday with the guys. We chilled a little bit at Rahul's place and then we went out to a few parties. It was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed being back with my guys after summer break. However, around 11:30 PM, I received a text from my good friend Shalini. She's one of the most wonderful people I have met and I really enjoy talking to her. I went to her apartment and we talked there for over 2 hours! I realized we have so many things in common with each other, like a lot more than usual! We talked about the bahamas, our high school lives, school, classes, the crazy amount of work we have, and even about our friends and view on our life. It was a lot of fun and I enjoyed being with her. I kept staring at her for the longest time, and I would just really enjoy making eye contact and her smile was awesome (yeah, I'm THAT kind of guy).
					<p class="newBlogParagraph">Anyway, I left around 2:30 AM, took the bus back home, and before going to sleep, I actually made some advancements to the Hyperloop website. I'm in this RSO (Registered Student Organizations) called Illini Hyperloop, and they deal with the hyperloop project <a href="http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop">posted by SpaceX</a>. The website I made is here: <a href="http://illinihyperloop.github.io/">Illini Hyperloop</a>. I'm pretty new at web development right now, so I'm learning as I go. But since it's more of an informational website, I think it was a perfect way for me to strengthen my skills. The background color was gray and the website was still in its early stages. I don't know why, but I always found that gray looks very "clean" and "professional" on a website. Even the early stages of this website was gray and white with black font. So of course, I had a "gray theme" type design. I updated it to make it a bit more blue (since blue is popular everywhere, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc). So now the website has a light blue color (hmm... similar to a different website with huge letters at the top of a person's name...). Anyway, I was so tired at that point I just crashed.</p>
					<p class="newBlogParagraph">Woke up around 12:30 PM. Breath felt nasty (as usual) since I totally forgot to brush my teeth last night (not usual; I'm a hygenic person, contrary to the popular engineer stereotypes). It was late, but whatever. I think I crashed around 3:30 AM? Something like that. I went on my laptop and cellphone to check for any notifications or emails from important people. I was hoping my research professor did not email to me since I was pretty behind on his work. He didn't, so that was good new (for now...). I texted my good friend Sara. Sara was probably my best female friend in high school and I really like to spend time with her. She invited me to lunch at the Ike, so I quickly got ready and rushed to the bus stop. The bus system on the weekends really sucks. Yes, I know bus drivers have a life, but I was there was some other system. Anyway, I was lucky since the bus was coming in about 8 minutes, and it runs once every 30 minutes. I got on the bus and I went to the Ike and found her there. We had lunch there and then I went back to her dorm to see her rommate Minako. She's a really nice person from what she said and I wanted to meet her (Japanese Student, international). Unfortunately, she wasn't there, so I just chilled in Sara's room for a while. We talked here and there, and eventually, she crashed. I was writing this in the mean time, and I was mostly just waiting for her to wake up. She woke up dreaming, and I could tell because she said "It's not a cow, it's a cat." Now Sara is in the Pre-Vet program here, and I guess it made somewhat of some sense. But that was a bit funny, and we both laughed it off. I left once she woke up, and now I'm back in my apartment.</p>
					<p class="newBlogParagraph">About 12:58 AM on my Macbook's clock. Another thing about me is that I have a weak stomach. Right now I'm lying in bed with a pretty bad stomach ache. I just finished playing some League of Legends with my friends from the Chicago Suburbs, but I also missed out on a different event with my friends that were here.</p>

					<h2>&lt;/Weekend&gt;<span class="dates">Friday, Aug 30 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Gosh, I wake up to my roommate yelling about League of Legends. I don't think I have seen him anywhere besides his "league" table for 2 days now. He plays with his other friends from where he grew up (I think India? Or the middle east? I can't remember). Anyway, I didn't say anything because I needed to wake up anyway. I've been doing nothing the past 2 days because I've been feeling so lazy. I started this post around 10:30 AM, but I've been editing the CSS for this website for the past 2 hours, trying to make it responsive. I could have just used Bootstrap, but I dislike Bootstrap because I feel like it's the "easy way." Anyway, I think I got it to work now (test it out and tell me!), and I hope people on mobile screens can read it in the future. I also added the "Latest Post" at the top of the page. Now most blogs have their latest posts at the top and then they go into the past. I didn't like that either. I don't even know if this is a blog yet or anything, but I really wanted to make this page a bit different. If you look at Twitter, Tumblr, or even Facebook, they all have their "posts" from the present to the past and I wanted to simulate that.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So it's about 10:43 AM (long time, right?) and I just feel so tired. My stomach has still been aching from time to time and it's not helping at all. I really should do my CS173 and PHYS212 homework, but ndjkbsgjfds, I don't know. I was thinking about development the other day, and it's really crazy (my thoughts are racing almost all the time, so expect quick jumps in topics). Like the entire world now is completely reliant on the Internet. I mean, just imagine, what would happen if the Internet went away for even a few seconds, or milliseconds. Backups would not work, websites would crash, servers wouldn't communicate properly. And besides the infrastructure, imagine all the data that could potentially be lost! I read it somewhere, but 90% of all data was created in the last 2 years. <i>And most likely, it's all stored online.</i></p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Finished watching some YouTube and browsing some Reddit. Man, reddit is one of the best sources of entertainment! There's information on <i>everything</i> there! Anyway, forget that. My roommate, since about 8 in the morning, is still on League of Legends. It's approximately... 5:28 PM right now. He's either watching LCS or playing the game. I mean I know I used to play a lot too, but not to this amount. He climbed from Silver V to Silver III in less than 24 hours. I mean, that's a LOT of games! Anyway, what bugged me most is that he came to me and asked me if I was downloading anything because he was "lagging during his promos." R u srs bro? That made me a little angry. I am paying rent for this apartment, I can use my Internet as well. Anyway, I'm pretty sure I know what was causing the lag. Whenever I play YouTube, he starts complaining to his Skype buddies that he's lagging. I don't want to ruin his game on purpose, but I want my entertainment as well. That was a while ago, now he's just watching LCS with his friends. I didn't do much since the morning. After I finished my RHET105 essay (which was about a page and a half), I played League of Legends with my friends as well. Now I know I just complained about my roommate playing it, but I just finished my essay, I wanted to take a small break too. I played for about 2 or 3 games, and then I get off. For those of you who don't know, a typical League of Legends game ranges from 20-45 minutes, but on average, I'd say they're about 35 minutes long. After playing, I chatted with one of my good friends: Vyoma. Vyoma is an old friend of mine (wow I sound old, don't I?) from freshman year of high school. Unfortunately, she's not the best at texting... So the "conversation" lasted about 10-15 minutes. I really wish she went here at UIUC, I would like to talk to her again. But she's studying medical elsewhere.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph"><span style="color:red">&lt;rant&gt;</span></p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Wow, my roommate finally gets off his laptop. I don't know how you can stand after sitting for so long. Before I continue to talk about my roommate, there are something you should know. I do NOT dislike my roommate. I'm the one who asked him to room with me, and he did so willingly. Otherwise I probably would have had to stay in a single. The only thing that somewhat ticks me off is that he's a computer science major and he does nothing with it. Like I'm a Computer Engineer, but I have absolutely no interest in Computer Engineering. I only care about the software side of things.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">"Why aren't you CS then, Shank?"</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">I applied here for Computer Science. The admissions people put me in Electrical Engineering (how are they even related?!), and since Electrical Engineering is in the same department as Computer Engineering, I switched as fast as I could to CompE. Why didn't I switch to CS? They told me that I had to apply for CS after some time, and then I could probably get in. OK, no problems so far. Then I realized that was a huge mistake. CS here is a very difficult program to get into. And I wanted CS Engineering, not LAS (Liberal Arts and Sciences) CS. At this point, I'm ready to get into any of them. I very much dislike Computer Engineering. The majors are related, but I want to focus on software only. Also, CS is a lot more "fun" to me. My dad always tells me that "You go to college to study, not to have fun." Yeah, well, you can't really study or have fun if you're studying something you're not interested in at all. Now, they've raised the requirements for CS to the point where it's difficult to achieve them. The good thing is, Computer Engineering has a lot of similar courses to Computer Science, but it's their hardware ones that I have no interest for. I really dislike studying hardware. I understand its importance, and it's definitely needed, but ughhh djjksdfhgdkjshg, dislike dislike.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph"><span style="color:red;">&lt;/rant&gt;</span></p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Just finished dinner, it's about 8:33 PM right now. My friends Rahul, Karan, and Michael came. Not going to lie, they really changed my life here in college. I didn't have all that many friends in high school, and I really wanted to change that when I came here. I spoke a lot more and talked to a lot more people, and then I met Rahul. Rahul is one of the funniest people I know. I was really happy that I got closer to him and the other guys. Anyway, we all had dinner from a Chinese restaurant. The restaurant took quite a long time to make the food, but the food was very tasty once we ate it. The restaurant was full, so we went to my apartment to eat. My roommate, of course, was on the dining table watching LCS. He was playing the audio, so my friend Rahul suggested we eat in the lounge. I brought us some plates (which I still have to wash and clean... ugh) and we ate there. We talked about stuff and laughed, and I felt good. I had done nothing all day and I felt happy to chill with them for a while. Before I left, I showed them the gym and game room at my apartment. They really liked it and they said we should have a nice kickback at my place. That made me feel happy. I don't know, I wasn't always the person to get a lot of invites back in high school (OMG TOTAL LOSER ALERT), but whatever.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So I am talking to my friend Shrina, and she has guys problems right now. I know this is going to sound very typical, but why do girls always go for the jerks? Now I am judging them purely based on what girls have told me about their relationship problems, but from my views, it has always seemed like the guy is just being a jerk to the girl.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Probably my last paragraph on here. It's about 1:41 AM right now, and I'm talking to my friend Shalini. I just got off League of Legends (should have done homework...) and I'm a bit tired now. I finished my work for tomorrow, but I really need to get moving on my State Farm project and my research project. I keep getting distracted with the Internet. I really want to make cool, new apps. The problem is not the learning curve. You must learn to create new things. The main problem is the length of time necessary to learn to make new stuff. It takes a while to learn something new, and I mostly just want to dive right in. I know it doesn't work this way, but I'm still stubborn (eventually I'll come out of it). That's how most software is made anyway. I'm going to talk to Shalini and then eventually crash.</p>
