				<p class="newBlogParagraph">I'll make this quick since I know you all want to get to the juicy stuff below. My name's Shashank Saxena (if you couldn't tell from the huge letters at the top). I am a student at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign admitted for Computer Engineering. This part of my website is NOT about my work. I won't mention what I've done so far, all my cool achievements, or anything. It's simply my day to day life and my thoughts on it. If you want to see what I have done, you can go to the <a href="index.html">home page</a>. This part is strictly my personal life. I may <i>mention</i> my work, my thoughts on it, but I won't talk about it into too much technical detail.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Also, quick tip: The picture of me on the homepage is a shortcut to this page!</p>

					<h2>Incomplete<span class="dates">Wednesday, Sept 9, 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Okay, so yes, I didn't complete yesterday's post. I meant to do that, but I had a <strong>very</strong> busy day yesterday. Anyway, it's like 9AM right now, and I woke up around 8AM, even though my class is at 11AM... Not sure what I'm doing with my life.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Anyway, yesterday was the UIUC Corproate After Hours Informal Career Fair (that's a mouthful). I applied to several companies, but it seems that Groupon showed interest in me. Hopefully this doesn't turn other recruiters away (I love you all!), but I'm fairly new to this stuff. I'm only a sophomore. Don't get me wrong, I know how it all works. But interning at an actual technical company is something I'm really looking forward too. I need to fix my GPA first. It's not terribly low, but it's definitely not as high as I want it to be. Mostly it was due to a stage of depress I had hit last semester which made me botch a technical class pretty badly. But I've come out from that and I am going to do my best to fix it. Also, today is the bigger career fair: the ECS Career Fair. It starts around 10AM and continue until about 4PM. I want to go there as well and hit almost every company I can that is into web development.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So I just got ready and my gosh, tying a tie is one of the most difficult things I have ever done. I used something called the '4 in hand' knot, but that was seriously difficult. Even now, my tie is messed up. The shorter end is longer than the wider end, but I just looped it back in and use a tie clip. It looks normal from the outside, which I guess is what matters anyway. Hopefully it doesn't come down while I'm talking to a recruiter. That would be pretty embarassing. So I have class from 11 to 12 and from 12 to 2, which really sucks because I don't have much time for the career fair. I want to hit a few start ups and try for some bigger companies. I'm probably way out of reach for Google, Microsoft, Facebook; you know, the best companies are the best because they recruit the best. I would like to apply to Microsoft, but I dunno. They might just trash my resume. I saw a Yak yesterday that said 'I hope recruiters at least recycle my resume after they're done looking at it.' That was a really great view to look at the career fair. But now that I think about it, I feel like I don't know much either. I mean I only did a little bit of web development this past summer at State Farm, and some database project (which was actually a prototype). I hope I get something. If I can get one internship at a technical company, I would be very happy. Not so much for being a technical company, but I really want to learn the full stack. I feel that the web will eventually overtake everything (including native applications). We already use the web to contact servers through native apps, so I feel like most of it is already there. The more difficult thing about web is making front-end GUIs (at least that's what I think). I've never worked in a professional environment before, so I could be totally wrong. But that's just how I feel it works out so far.</p>

					<h2>NodeJS The Beast<span class="dates">Wednesday, Sept 2, 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So I crashed very early yesterday. I was just really tired and just wanted some sleep. I did talk to a few people before going to sleep, but nothing major. I did miss a conversation from Shalini though &#9785;. Oh well, I will try to talk to her today. So it's about 8:48 AM right now, and I am lying in my bed. I'm not sure why I am up this early, or even what to do at this time. Again, I wasn't able to finish my story for yesterday, but I don't want to explain that anymore, with the exception of being sick. So my sickness did reduce. I drank about 2 glasses of pretty darn hot water (but not burning) and I woke up feeling much better. Even my cold/running nose seems to have mitigated. I have to go on a "field" trip to this one place for my RHET105 class. I didn't even know college <i>does</i> field trips! It's a little bit south of campus, but I'll probaby ride my motorized bicycle there. I don't know why we are going there. Field trips have never helped me understand new concepts or learn anything new. The only good thing to this is that I don't have to attend lecture, and that's one more day down. Right afterwards, I have a PHYS212 quiz that I should really study for. Since it's only the first one, I'm not all that concerned, but it still is a quiz, and I want to do well. We're learning about electric fields, and I'm a little bit confused on the direction. I even went and asked a TA at office hours, and he wasn't able to explain it to me too well. So I'll try to study that before I head off to RHET.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So going to RHET was not fun at all. I had to go to this Horticulture lab place, that was pretty south of almost everything on campus. It did have a university sign (so maybe it is on campus?), but it was still pretty far. My motorized bike got me there fine, not too many problems. However, it ran out of gas when I had to go back. That really sucked considering going back north was uphill (oh the pain...). Whatever, I finished my job there and I got out. At the lab, however, we saw these cool "archives" of UIUC's history. The lady said stuff about how they archive everything (movies, videos, plays, books, regulations, etc), and they showed us most of the historical stuff. I think our essay is on one of the artifacts.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So it's about 11:24 PM right now, and I haven't posted much. After the RHET field trip, I went and took my physics quiz (which I'm still a little bit confused on with the direction of electric fields). Hopefully that went well. After that, I went to my internship and tried to tackle NodeJS. NodeJS is honestly one of the worst-best JavaScript... frameworks? Not exactly sure what to call it, but it's very, very difficult to learn, but once you learn it, it's pretty easy to set up powerful web applications. So eventually I quit and just ended up learning some more fundamental concepts in JavaScript, and tried a different tutorial for Node. We'll see where that goes in the future. After my internship, it started raining, and I was wearing socks n' slides, basketball shorts and a t-shirt (my typical everyday clothes). Luckily I had an umbrella, but the wind picked up pretty fast and I was pretty wet anyway. I ended up going to Siebel since they had free food there, and I wanted to have dinner. I ended up being at hackerspace (essentially CS196 office hours) for a while talking to Tanishq. We got food and chatted for a while, but I eventually had to leave and go do homework. I got back to my apartment, said hello to the <s>dining table</s> my roommate, and I went into my room. I initially started to do my CS173 homework, but then I started browsing the internet, and I came across an article of some Google employee who quit his job (WHAT?!) to join HackerRank. I checked out the website, and I was a little bit absorbed into it too. But I was no where near as good as that guy, but I still did do a few online challenges with Python. Anyway, I finished up CS173 and started talking to Shalini again. She had messaged me yesterday, and I was kind of annoyed at myself for sleeping that early. Anyway, we were chatting and I had the guts to ask her to dinner. Just as friends, you know? Nothing more than that. I just want to see how things go. She said, "I'll let you know.", which probably just means no. That's OK; I've faced this plenty of times before <img src="http://www.pic4ever.com/images/consoling2.gif"> After chatting, I did some of my work on my research project with my professor. I feel terrible to delay the professor this much, and he still has the patience to put up with me. I got some error on the installation of the files, so I just sent him an email saying I'll work on it tomorrow. I think I know what the issue is, but it will take a bit of time, so I just postponed it to tomorrow. Anyway, I'll probably be on HackerRank and then eventually fall asleep.</p>

					<h2>CS196<span class="dates">Tueday, Sept 1, 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Holy crap. It's about 9:21 PM and I'm sitting in the CS196 lecture. I should probably do my CS173 homework, but I would feel awkward leaving in the middle. Anyway, I was assigned the job of signing people onto the website and making sure their ideas were updated on there. That was probably one of the craziest things I've done. There was an army smashed into a small room, and I have to individually make sure they were all taken care of. And what's great is that we had a limited amount of computers for them to use, but they had to get through it within 1 minute. That was a mess, and whatever, I tried to do the best I could. The website probably has a few bugs here and there, but I didn't help develop it, so I don't want to bag on them. It was made in a short time as well, so whatever. Anyway, my day today was pretty normal, with the exception of my sickness.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">I had to focus on finishing my CS173 homework, so I cut off the last part. Each "break" essentially means a different time I'm writing something (for future reference). It's about 11:11 PM right now (make a wish!) and I am pretty tired from today. So as I was saying before, my sickness is not helping me at all. I absolutely hate being sick. Not really because I care for my body (I do!), but mostly because it hinders me from learning and concentrating. I want learn all of the content (with the exception of assembly in ECE220).</p>

					<h2>TFW You Help Others<span class="dates">Monday, Aug 31, 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Well I didn't go to my internship this morning. I was supposed to go so I can complete my hours, but I just can't get out of my comfortable bed. I searched last night for my PHYS212 lab manual. I thought I had bought everything, but it turn out I didn't buy that. So I got out of my apartment by around 9:45 AM to get the lab manual from the bookstore. I don't know why, but ever since I woke up, I've been starting to feel as if I have a sore throat. Gosh, I hate getting sick. I've gotten sick every time the season changes, and I hate it so much. I wanted to get ice cream today since I haven't had it in a while, but RIP to that idea. Anyway, after getting my book, I went to the Illini Union to find somewhere to sit down. Every single chair, sofa, and couch was taken by either students sleeping, just sitting there, or working. I walked around the entire place until I found a "chair" that was just a bench with no back support. I was a bit annoyed, but I can't just kick someone off.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So last night, I was messaging this girl (AWHH BOII) and she said she needed help with setting up a website. It's similar to how this website is hosted, so I said I would like to help her. I'm meeting her today at 7 PM in the Union. So hopefully I can help her there. She's a freshman in CS (oh, the jealousy), and she posted on the UIUC class of 2019 page.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">It's approximately 6:46 PM right now. I need to get started on that CS173 reading and homework, but I promised this girl I would help her on her website. I hope she comes soon. She said she would buy me Jamba Juice, and I really wish I could have gotten it, but this sore throat of mine is not helping. Oh well, I can buy it anytime later. So today, after classes, I ate at Koto Ramen again. I ate there a few days earlier, and I absolutely loved their food, so of course I would go a second time. I ordered the regular Teppanyaki Chicken dish, the dinner size. I should have ordered the lunch size since I wasn't able to finish all of it, but whatever, I crammed in as much as I could. I went to my State Farm internship afterwards. I finally met the other kid I was working with, a guy named Jacob. He's a nice guy. General Engineering major, CS minor, but he didn't have too much web dev knowledge (basically me when I entered college). Anyway, I was working on learning NodeJS and he asked me to meet Ryan, our "supervisor". We met Ryan, and we talked about the details of our project. Later on, he left immediately afterwards (probably because the guy had no idea where to start). I left a little bit later too, I needed to go finish my PHYS212 and CS173 homework.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Finished up my CS173 homework and essentially all my PHYS212 homework. It's about 10:32 PM right now, and I'm actually kind of tired. I just got off texting my sister, and</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So I totally didn't finish the last paragraph because I ended up chatting with a few people and i closed my text editor. But now I'm good! Focused on blogging... So the grill (yes, grill) I helped today appreciated my help. She messaged me on Facebook and we chatted and stuff. Right now it's about 12:25 AM, and I really should sleep, but I want to properly finish this post. So anyway, we finished talking about 5 minutes ago (yeah, we talked for a while), and I think she crashed. To talk about before all that, today was a pretty standard day... With the exception of PHYS212. So I thought I had all my materials for my physics lab, but I wa actually missing my lab manual. I bought it just before my day began, but I forgot there was a pre-lab assignment that was due! So I ran to the Union, found a stand that was next to the ATMs, and did it there as fast as I could. Luckily, it was just the first one, so I didn't have to turn in much. But dang, that was some fast work on my part. Physics lab went alright as well, although my TA is not as chill as my TA from last year. She wants us to actually write out everything, and I dislike writing. I mean for physics, aren't just quick, small sentence fragments good enough?! I guess this was college, so I have to adjust, but I mean if you can get your point across, I feel like that's good enough. Anyway, that was kind of a drag. At least my lab meets once every other week, so I won't be doing too much of that. After lab, I ate at Koto Ramen, and I "blogged" for a little bit. Once I came back from my internship, that's where I met the girl who I was going to help create a website for, and I think both of us left there around 8:30ish PM. I wasn't in the mood to make dinner, so I just grabbed McDonald's on the way back. I probably should have grabbed something healthier, but I just wanted to get through with dinner. My roommate is in his regular spot again, and so I just walk back into my room. I still need to clean my dishes from when the guys came over... But I'll try to do it tomorrow (JUST DO IT! YESTERDAY YOU SAID TOMORROW!) I was just kind of tired at this point. I finished up CS173 homework and "blogged" for a bit more. I came back, and for once, I found my roommate not in his regular spot. He was actually sleeping! <img src="http://www.pic4ever.com/images/Banane21.gif"> Oh, I don't think I mentioned this! He got his desk last week, and he hasn't built it yet because he's too busy playing League of Legends all the time in his regular spot. His desk was well over $150, and he doesn't even care for it. My desk was about $60, and I "set" that up right away! I was so excited! He even got a super nice chair with some bogus headrest or whatever, and he hasn't built that either. Currently he takes up the dining table. I might ask him to move, but I don't want to be rude... Ugh, sometimes I wish I had just stayed in a single. But I wanted to get a double to sort of "prepare" myself to live and handle other people, you know?</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph"> Someday in the future, you are going to work with people who you don 't necessarily like blah blah blah" - every adult ever.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Whatever, I feel like I can manage people pretty well. Last semester in CS196, I had two teammates that were a bit annoying. One of them had no idea what was going on (I think I saw him like twice or three times?) and the other just complained about everything. I managed them pretty well and we pulled our stuff together and delivered. I'm just about to go to sleep now, it's almost 1, and I have a somewhat early class tomorrow.</p>

					<h2>&lt;/Weekend&gt;<span class="dates">Sunday, Aug 30, 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Gosh, I wake up to my roommate yelling about League of Legends. I don't think I have seen him anywhere besides his "league" table for 2 days now. He plays with his other friends from where he grew up (I think India? Or the middle east? I can 't remember). Anyway, I didn't say anything because I needed to wake up anyway. I 've been doing nothing the past 2 days because I've been feeling so lazy. I started this post around 10:30 AM, but I 've been editing the CSS for this website for the past 2 hours, trying to make it responsive. I could have just used Bootstrap, but I dislike Bootstrap because I feel like it's the "easy way." Anyway, I think I got it to work now (test it out and tell me!), and I hope people on mobile screens can read it in the future. <s>I also added the "Latest Post" at the top of the page. Now most blogs have their latest posts at the top and then they go into the past. I didn't like that either. I don't even know if this is a blog yet or anything, but I really wanted to make this page a bit different. If you look at Twitter, Tumblr, or even Facebook, they all have their "posts" from the present to the past and I wanted to simulate that.</s> I talked to people. It wasn't the best idea. Changed it on Aug 31 2015.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So it's about 10:43 AM (long time, right?) and I just feel so tired. My stomach has still been aching from time to time and it's not helping at all. I really should do my CS173 and PHYS212 homework, but ndjkbsgjfds, I don't know. I was thinking about development the other day, and it's really crazy (my thoughts are racing almost all the time, so expect quick jumps in topics). Like the entire world now is completely reliant on the Internet. I mean, just imagine, what would happen if the Internet went away for even a few seconds, or milliseconds. Backups would not work, websites would crash, servers wouldn't communicate properly. And besides the infrastructure, imagine all the data that could potentially be lost! I read it somewhere, but 90% of all data was created in the last 2 years. <i>And most likely, it's all stored online.</i></p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Finished watching some YouTube and browsing some Reddit. Man, reddit is one of the best sources of entertainment! There's information on <i>everything</i> there! Anyway, forget that. My roommate, since about 8 in the morning, is still on League of Legends. It's approximately... 5:28 PM right now. He's either watching LCS or playing the game. I mean I know I used to play a lot too, but not to this amount. He climbed from Silver V to Silver III in less than 24 hours. I mean, that's a LOT of games! Anyway, what bugged me most is that he came to me and asked me if I was downloading anything because he was "lagging during his promos." R u srs bro? That made me a little angry. I am paying rent for this apartment, I can use my Internet as well. Anyway, I'm pretty sure I know what was causing the lag. Whenever I play YouTube, he starts complaining to his Skype buddies that he's lagging. I don't want to ruin his game on purpose, but I want my entertainment as well. That was a while ago, now he's just watching LCS with his friends. I didn't do much since the morning. After I finished my RHET105 essay (which was about a page and a half), I played League of Legends with my friends as well. Now I know I just complained about my roommate playing it, but I just finished my essay, I wanted to take a small break too. I played for about 2 or 3 games, and then I get off. For those of you who don't know, a typical League of Legends game ranges from 20-45 minutes, but on average, I'd say they're about 35 minutes long. After playing, I chatted with one of my good friends: Vyoma. Vyoma is an old friend of mine (wow I sound old, don't I?) from freshman year of high school. Unfortunately, she's not the best at texting... So the "conversation" lasted about 10-15 minutes. I really wish she went here at UIUC, I would like to talk to her again. But she's studying medical elsewhere.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph"><span style="color:red">&lt;rant&gt;</span></p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Wow, my roommate finally gets off his laptop. I don't know how you can stand after sitting for so long. Before I continue to talk about my roommate, there are something you should know. I do NOT dislike my roommate. I'm the one who asked him to room with me, and he did so willingly. Otherwise I probably would have had to stay in a single. The only thing that somewhat ticks me off is that he's a computer science major and he does nothing with it. Like I'm a Computer Engineer, but I have absolutely no interest in Computer Engineering. I only care about the software side of things.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">"Why aren't you CS then, Shank?"</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">I applied here for Computer Science. The admissions people put me in Electrical Engineering (how are they even related?!), and since Electrical Engineering is in the same department as Computer Engineering, I switched as fast as I could to CompE. Why didn't I switch to CS? They told me that I had to apply for CS after some time, and then I could probably get in. OK, no problems so far. Then I realized that was a huge mistake. CS here is a very difficult program to get into. And I wanted CS Engineering, not LAS (Liberal Arts and Sciences) CS. At this point, I'm ready to get into any of them. I very much dislike Computer Engineering. The majors are related, but I want to focus on software only. Also, CS is a lot more "fun" to me. My dad always tells me that "You go to college to study, not to have fun." Yeah, well, you can't really study or have fun if you're studying something you're not interested in at all. Now, they've raised the requirements for CS to the point where it's difficult to achieve them. The good thing is, Computer Engineering has a lot of similar courses to Computer Science, but it's their hardware ones that I have no interest for. I really dislike studying hardware. I understand its importance, and it's definitely needed, but ughhh djjksdfhgdkjshg, dislike dislike.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph"><span style="color:red;">&lt;/rant&gt;</span></p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Just finished dinner, it's about 8:33 PM right now. My friends Rahul, Karan, and Michael came. Not going to lie, they really changed my life here in college. I didn't have all that many friends in high school, and I really wanted to change that when I came here. I spoke a lot more and talked to a lot more people, and then I met Rahul. Rahul is one of the funniest people I know. I was really happy that I got closer to him and the other guys. Anyway, we all had dinner from a Chinese restaurant. The restaurant took quite a long time to make the food, but the food was very tasty once we ate it. The restaurant was full, so we went to my apartment to eat. My roommate, of course, was on the dining table watching LCS. He was playing the audio, so my friend Rahul suggested we eat in the lounge. I brought us some plates (which I still have to wash and clean... ugh) and we ate there. We talked about stuff and laughed, and I felt good. I had done nothing all day and I felt happy to chill with them for a while. Before I left, I showed them the gym and game room at my apartment. They really liked it and they said we should have a nice kickback at my place. That made me feel happy. I don't know, I wasn't always the person to get a lot of invites back in high school (OMG TOTAL LOSER ALERT), but whatever.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So I am talking to my friend Shrina, and she has guys problems right now. I know this is going to sound very typical, but why do girls always go for the jerks? Now I am judging them purely based on what girls have told me about their relationship problems, but from my views, it has always seemed like the guy is just being a jerk to the girl.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Probably my last paragraph on here. It's about 1:41 AM right now, and I'm talking to my friend Shalini. I just got off League of Legends (should have done homework...) and I'm a bit tired now. I finished my work for tomorrow, but I really need to get moving on my State Farm project and my research project. I keep getting distracted with the Internet. I really want to make cool, new apps. The problem is not the learning curve. You must learn to create new things. The main problem is the length of time necessary to learn to make new stuff. It takes a while to learn something new, and I mostly just want to dive right in. I know it doesn't work this way, but I'm still stubborn (eventually I'll come out of it). That's how most software is made anyway. I'm going to talk to Shalini and then eventually crash.</p>

					<h2>&lt;Weekend&gt; <span class="dates">Saturday, Aug 29, 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Hey all. Often I won't finish my blog posts because I have other work to do. It seems a little rude, but I will try my best to post on here as much as I can. Anyway, it's about 3:08 PM. So I woke up today after going out yesterday with the guys. We chilled a little bit at Rahul's place and then we went out to a few parties. It was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed being back with my guys after summer break. However, around 11:30 PM, I received a text from my good friend Shalini. She's one of the most wonderful people I have met and I really enjoy talking to her. I went to her apartment and we talked there for over 2 hours! I realized we have so many things in common with each other, like a lot more than usual! We talked about the bahamas, our high school lives, school, classes, the crazy amount of work we have, and even about our friends and view on our life. It was a lot of fun and I enjoyed being with her. I kept staring at her for the longest time, and I would just really enjoy making eye contact and her smile was awesome (yeah, I'm THAT kind of guy).
					<p class="newBlogParagraph">Anyway, I left around 2:30 AM, took the bus back home, and before going to sleep, I actually made some advancements to the Hyperloop website. I'm in this RSO (Registered Student Organizations) called Illini Hyperloop, and they deal with the hyperloop project <a href="http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop">posted by SpaceX</a>. The website I made is here: <a href="http://illinihyperloop.github.io/">Illini Hyperloop</a>. I'm pretty new at web development right now, so I'm learning as I go. But since it's more of an informational website, I think it was a perfect way for me to strengthen my skills. The background color was gray and the website was still in its early stages. I don't know why, but I always found that gray looks very "clean" and "professional" on a website. Even the early stages of this website was gray and white with black font. So of course, I had a "gray theme" type design. I updated it to make it a bit more blue (since blue is popular everywhere, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc). So now the website has a light blue color (hmm... similar to a different website with huge letters at the top of a person's name...). Anyway, I was so tired at that point I just crashed.</p>
					<p class="newBlogParagraph">Woke up around 12:30 PM. Breath felt nasty (as usual) since I totally forgot to brush my teeth last night (not usual; I'm a hygenic person, contrary to the popular engineer stereotypes). It was late, but whatever. I think I crashed around 3:30 AM? Something like that. I went on my laptop and cellphone to check for any notifications or emails from important people. I was hoping my research professor did not email to me since I was pretty behind on his work. He didn't, so that was good new (for now...). I texted my good friend Sara. Sara was probably my best female friend in high school and I really like to spend time with her. She invited me to lunch at the Ike, so I quickly got ready and rushed to the bus stop. The bus system on the weekends really sucks. Yes, I know bus drivers have a life, but I was there was some other system. Anyway, I was lucky since the bus was coming in about 8 minutes, and it runs once every 30 minutes. I got on the bus and I went to the Ike and found her there. We had lunch there and then I went back to her dorm to see her rommate Minako. She's a really nice person from what she said and I wanted to meet her (Japanese Student, international). Unfortunately, she wasn't there, so I just chilled in Sara's room for a while. We talked here and there, and eventually, she crashed. I was writing this in the mean time, and I was mostly just waiting for her to wake up. She woke up dreaming, and I could tell because she said "It's not a cow, it's a cat." Now Sara is in the Pre-Vet program here, and I guess it made somewhat of some sense. But that was a bit funny, and we both laughed it off. I left once she woke up, and now I'm back in my apartment.</p>
					<p class="newBlogParagraph">About 12:58 AM on my Macbook's clock. Another thing about me is that I have a weak stomach. Right now I'm lying in bed with a pretty bad stomach ache. I just finished playing some League of Legends with my friends from the Chicago Suburbs, but I also missed out on a different event with my friends that were here.</p>

					<h2>Hello World! <span class="dates">Friday, Aug 28, 2015</span></h2></div>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Hello World! This will serve as my personal "blog" for the time being. I didn't really want to use WordPress, Blogger, or any other external service. I think it would be nice if I can format the blog to my own personalized settings! Also, before I get started, I would like you let you all know that most of my blog posts will be very, very long due to how much I express during my day. I want to put essentially most of my college life here so that I can look back in the future. Anyway, onto blogging... </p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">So it's approximately 10:40 AM right now, and I'm waiting to go to my RHET105 class. By the way, RHET105 is definitely a class I do NOT look forward going to. I understand that writing is important and very crucial to your career, but I don't think I will be using it too much. Anyway, I met this dude name Jimmy (John? James? Jimbo?). He's another student I know that is in DGS and trying to transfer to Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Oh how little these freshman know about transferring and how difficult it is right now to get in... I say the previous statement with experience. I came to UIUC with interest purely in Computer Science.</p>
				<p class="newBlogParagraph">Roughly 5:20 PM right now. I'm at State Farm, sitting next to my troll buddy Chris. He's a good friend of mine I met when I initially started to intern at State Farm. I like him, and in fact, he's the person who inspired me to make my own website and learn more about web development. I'm supposed to be learning NodeJS and I'm have a very, very difficult time doing that!</p>
