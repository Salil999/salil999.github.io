						<h2>NodeJS The Beast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:0.3em;">Wednesday, Sept 02, 2015</span></h2>
					</header>
					<p>So I crashed very early yesterday. I was just really tired and just wanted some sleep. I did talk to a few people before going to sleep, but nothing major. I did miss a conversation from Shalini though &#9785;. Oh well, I will try to talk to her today. So it's about 8:48 AM right now, and I am lying in my bed. I'm not sure why I am up this early, or even what to do at this time. Again, I wasn't able to finish my story for yesterday, but I don't want to explain that anymore, with the exception of being sick. So my sickness did reduce. I drank about 2 glasses of pretty darn hot water (but not burning) and I woke up feeling much better. Even my cold/running nose seems to have mitigated. I have to go on a "field" trip to this one place for my RHET105 class. I didn't even know college <i>does</i> field trips! It's a little bit south of campus, but I'll probaby ride my motorized bicycle there. I don't know why we are going there. Field trips have never helped me understand new concepts or learn anything new. The only good thing to this is that I don't have to attend lecture, and that's one more day down. Right afterwards, I have a PHYS212 quiz that I should really study for. Since it's only the first one, I'm not all that concerned, but it still is a quiz, and I want to do well. We're learning about electric fields, and I'm a little bit confused on the direction. I even went and asked a TA at office hours, and he wasn't able to explain it to me too well. So I'll try to study that before I head off to RHET.
						<br>
						<br> So going to RHET was not fun at all. I had to go to this Horticulture lab place, that was pretty south of almost everything on campus. It did have a university sign (so maybe it is on campus?), but it was still pretty far. My motorized bike got me there fine, not too many problems. However, it ran out of gas when I had to go back. That really sucked considering going back north was uphill (oh the pain...). Whatever, I finished my job there and I got out. At the lab, however, we saw these cool "archives" of UIUC's history. The lady said stuff about how they archive everything (movies, videos, plays, books, regulations, etc), and they showed us most of the historical stuff. I think our essay is on one of the artifacts.
						<br>
						<br>So it's about 11:24 PM right now, and I haven't posted much. After the RHET field trip, I went and took my physics quiz (which I'm still a little bit confused on with the direction of electric fields). Hopefully that went well. After that, I went to my internship and tried to tackle NodeJS. NodeJS is honestly one of the worst-best JavaScript... frameworks? Not exactly sure what to call it, but it's very, very difficult to learn, but once you learn it, it's pretty easy to set up powerful web applications. So eventually I quit and just ended up learning some more fundamental concepts in JavaScript, and tried a different tutorial for Node. We'll see where that goes in the future. After my internship, it started raining, and I was wearing socks n' slides, basketball shorts and a t-shirt (my typical everyday clothes). Luckily I had an umbrella, but the wind picked up pretty fast and I was pretty wet anyway. I ended up going to Siebel since they had free food there, and I wanted to have dinner. I ended up being at hackerspace (essentially CS196 office hours) for a while talking to Tanishq. We got food and chatted for a while, but I eventually had to leave and go do homework. I got back to my apartment, said hello to the <s>dining table</s> my roommate, and I went into my room. I initially started to do my CS173 homework, but then I started browsing the internet, and I came across an article of some Google employee who quit his job (WHAT?!) to join HackerRank. I checked out the website, and I was a little bit absorbed into it too. But I was no where near as good as that guy, but I still did do a few online challenges with Python. Anyway, I finished up CS173 and started talking to Shalini again. She had messaged me yesterday, and I was kind of annoyed at myself for sleeping that early. Anyway, we were chatting and I had the guts to ask her to dinner. Just as friends, you know? Nothing more than that. I just want to see how things go. She said, "I'll let you know.", which probably just means no. That's OK; I've faced this plenty of times before <img src="http://www.pic4ever.com/images/consoling2.gif"> After chatting, I did some of my work on my research project with my professor. I feel terrible to delay the professor this much, and he still has the patience to put up with me. I got some error on the installation of the files, so I just sent him an email saying I'll work on it tomorrow. I think I know what the issue is, but it will take a bit of time, so I just postponed it to tomorrow. Anyway, I'll probably be on HackerRank and then eventually fall asleep.</p>
