						<h2>Hello World!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:0.3em;">Friday, Aug 28, 2015</span></h2>
					</header>
					<p>Hello World! This will serve as my personal "blog" for the time being. I didn't really want to use WordPress, Blogger, or any other external service. I think it would be nice if I can format the blog to my own personalized settings! Also, before I get started, I would like you let you all know that most of my blog posts will be very, very long due to how much I express during my day. I want to put essentially most of my college life here so that I can look back in the future. Anyway, onto blogging...
						<br>
						<br>So it's approximately 10:40 AM right now, and I'm waiting to go to my RHET105 class. By the way, RHET105 is definitely a class I do NOT look forward going to. I understand that writing is important and very crucial to your career, but I don't think I will be using it too much. Anyway, I met this dude name Jimmy (John? James? Jimbo?). He's another student I know that is in DGS and trying to transfer to Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Oh how little these freshman know about transferring and how difficult it is right now to get in... I say the previous statement with experience. I came to UIUC with interest purely in Computer Science.
						<br>
						<br>Roughly 5:20 PM right now. I'm at State Farm, sitting next to my troll buddy Chris. He's a good friend of mine I met when I initially started to intern at State Farm. I like him, and in fact, he's the person who inspired me to make my own website and learn more about web development. I'm supposed to be learning NodeJS and I'm have a very, very difficult time doing that!</p>
