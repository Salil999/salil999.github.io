						<h2>So... Much... Work!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:0.3em;">Monday, Sept 14, 2015</span></h2>
					</header>
					<p>So this blog is getting a bit too long, in terms of page height. I might just set a new page for each blog post, with the same CSS settings (you know, to keep the theme). Anyway, that's for me to do. So last night, I went to sleep trying to do my physics, but I was just unable to do it. I'm still really unmotivated to do anything, with the exception of CS-related stuff (I'm still salty at UIUC for that, they really need to fix their crappy management of the CS department). So I crashed, without doing any of my homework. Luckily, I woke up around 7:00 AM today and finished all of it. It's amazing how much I can do right before the work is due. What probably would have taken me all night took me roughly 2 hours to complete this morning. My earliest class today was 11:00 AM, so I wasn't too concerned on time. I even managed to sort my room a bit.
						<br>
						<br>So I had to do my RHET105 peer paper edits. Basically, we all wrote an essay using the Toulmin arguement, and we had to edit each others. I find this type of arguement to be pretty weird. I understand how you approach it and use it (I hope), but you basically argue anything choosing any side. Like I could say "Oh, owning a cellphone implies that you're rude at the dinner table." Like it doesn't even have to be related, but if you can have a good enough arguement, it works (even though my example is a little bit related) It's almost 11:00 AM right now, so I'll be heading off to class.
						<br>
						<br>So the beginning of class was a bit scary. No one was in the room for a while, and I was worried if I missed something. Recently I've been working on this Pebble app which will give you bus stop locations near your current location using the CUMTD API.
						<br>
						<br>It's about 1:51 AM right now, and I am pretty sleepy. I just wanted to add this last part to sort of complete the post. Today was mostly a physics day. I spent almost 3-4 hours on PHYS212. It's a tougher class than I had anticipated, but I think I have the concept down now. Gauss's Law and electric potential are really something. Now most engineers that I work with say "This class is so dumb, I'll never use this again." I disagree with that statement. Engineering definitely means to be skilled in whatever field of engineering you go into. But there's more to it. It's a way to solve and approach problems using a smart method. Doesn't matter what type of engineer you are, I think that taking physics really helps you accomplish this problem-solving approach. I will most likely end up being a programmer and will probably never use Gauss's Law ever again. But I need to know it now for two reasons. One, I definitely want to pass this class. Two, it opens my mind and lets me approach problems from different angles, and I hope I can use this somehow to my advantage in the future. But enough of the spiritual talk.
						<br>
						<br>There was a web designer career fair today at 6:30 PM, but I couldn't go since I was at physics office hours. I met my friend Gunjan at office hours, and she invited me for dinner. I went to her place, talked to her for a while, and ate dinner with her. It was nice to catch up with old friends. She had to study, so I didn't want to bother her and left shortly after dinner. That makes me seem like I just mooched off her food, but I told her <i>several</i> times that I don't want to do anything that would make me look like a hog or something. Okay, it's almost 2, and I need to sleep. Good night all.</p>
