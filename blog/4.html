					<p>Well I didn't go to my internship this morning. I was supposed to go so I can complete my hours, but I just can't get out of my comfortable bed. I searched last night for my PHYS212 lab manual. I thought I had bought everything, but it turn out I didn't buy that. So I got out of my apartment by around 9:45 AM to get the lab manual from the bookstore. I don't know why, but ever since I woke up, I've been starting to feel as if I have a sore throat. Gosh, I hate getting sick. I've gotten sick every time the season changes, and I hate it so much. I wanted to get ice cream today since I haven't had it in a while, but RIP to that idea. Anyway, after getting my book, I went to the Illini Union to find somewhere to sit down. Every single chair, sofa, and couch was taken by either students sleeping, just sitting there, or working. I walked around the entire place until I found a "chair" that was just a bench with no back support. I was a bit annoyed, but I can't just kick someone off.
						<br>
						<br>So last night, I was messaging this girl (AWHH BOII) and she said she needed help with setting up a website. It's similar to how this website is hosted, so I said I would like to help her. I'm meeting her today at 7 PM in the Union. So hopefully I can help her there. She's a freshman in CS (oh, the jealousy), and she posted on the UIUC class of 2019 page.
						<br>
						<br>It's approximately 6:46 PM right now. I need to get started on that CS173 reading and homework, but I promised this girl I would help her on her website. I hope she comes soon. She said she would buy me Jamba Juice, and I really wish I could have gotten it, but this sore throat of mine is not helping. Oh well, I can buy it anytime later. So today, after classes, I ate at Koto Ramen again. I ate there a few days earlier, and I absolutely loved their food, so of course I would go a second time. I ordered the regular Teppanyaki Chicken dish, the dinner size. I should have ordered the lunch size since I wasn't able to finish all of it, but whatever, I crammed in as much as I could. I went to my State Farm internship afterwards. I finally met the other kid I was working with, a guy named Jacob. He's a nice guy. General Engineering major, CS minor, but he didn't have too much web dev knowledge (basically me when I entered college). Anyway, I was working on learning NodeJS and he asked me to meet Ryan, our "supervisor". We met Ryan, and we talked about the details of our project. Later on, he left immediately afterwards (probably because the guy had no idea where to start). I left a little bit later too, I needed to go finish my PHYS212 and CS173 homework.
						<br>
						<br> Finished up my CS173 homework and essentially all my PHYS212 homework. It's about 10:32 PM right now, and I'm actually kind of tired. I just got off texting my sister, and
						<br>
						<br> So I totally didn't finish the last paragraph because I ended up chatting with a few people and i closed my text editor. But now I'm good! Focused on blogging... So the grill (yes, grill) I helped today appreciated my help. She messaged me on Facebook and we chatted and stuff. Right now it's about 12:25 AM, and I really should sleep, but I want to properly finish this post. So anyway, we finished talking about 5 minutes ago (yeah, we talked for a while), and I think she crashed. To talk about before all that, today was a pretty standard day... With the exception of PHYS212. So I thought I had all my materials for my physics lab, but I wa actually missing my lab manual. I bought it just before my day began, but I forgot there was a pre-lab assignment that was due! So I ran to the Union, found a stand that was next to the ATMs, and did it there as fast as I could. Luckily, it was just the first one, so I didn't have to turn in much. But dang, that was some fast work on my part. Physics lab went alright as well, although my TA is not as chill as my TA from last year. She wants us to actually write out everything, and I dislike writing. I mean for physics, aren't just quick, small sentence fragments good enough?! I guess this was college, so I have to adjust, but I mean if you can get your point across, I feel like that's good enough. Anyway, that was kind of a drag. At least my lab meets once every other week, so I won't be doing too much of that. After lab, I ate at Koto Ramen, and I "blogged" for a little bit. Once I came back from my internship, that's where I met the girl who I was going to help create a website for, and I think both of us left there around 8:30ish PM. I wasn't in the mood to make dinner, so I just grabbed McDonald's on the way back. I probably should have grabbed something healthier, but I just wanted to get through with dinner. My roommate is in his regular spot again, and so I just walk back into my room. I still need to clean my dishes from when the guys came over... But I'll try to do it tomorrow (JUST DO IT! YESTERDAY YOU SAID TOMORROW!) I was just kind of tired at this point. I finished up CS173 homework and "blogged" for a bit more. I came back, and for once, I found my roommate not in his regular spot. He was actually sleeping! <img src="http://www.pic4ever.com/images/Banane21.gif"> Oh, I don't think I mentioned this! He got his desk last week, and he hasn't built it yet because he's too busy playing League of Legends all the time in his regular spot. His desk was well over $150, and he doesn't even care for it. My desk was about $60, and I "set" that up right away! I was so excited! He even got a super nice chair with some bogus headrest or whatever, and he hasn't built that either. Currently he takes up the dining table. I might ask him to move, but I don't want to be rude... Ugh, sometimes I wish I had just stayed in a single. But I wanted to get a double to sort of "prepare" myself to live and handle other people, you know? Someday in the future, you are going to work with people who you don 't necessarily like blah blah blah" - every adult ever.
						<br>
						<br>Whatever, I feel like I can manage people pretty well. Last semester in CS196, I had two teammates that were a bit annoying. One of them had no idea what was going on (I think I saw him like twice or three times?) and the other just complained about everything. I managed them pretty well and we pulled our stuff together and delivered. I'm just about to go to sleep now, it's almost 1, and I have a somewhat early class tomorrow.
