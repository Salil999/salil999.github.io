					<p>Yesterday was the UIUC Corproate After Hours Informal Career Fair (that's a mouthful). I applied to several companies, but it seems that Groupon showed interest in me. Hopefully this doesn't turn other recruiters away (I love you all!), but I'm fairly new to this stuff. I'm only a sophomore. Don't get me wrong, I know how it all works. But interning at an actual technical company is something I'm really looking forward too. I need to fix my GPA first. It's not terribly low, but it's definitely not as high as I want it to be. Mostly it was due to a stage of depress I had hit last semester which made me botch a technical class pretty badly. But I've come out from that and I am going to do my best to fix it. Also, today is the bigger career fair: the ECS Career Fair. It starts around 10AM and continue until about 4PM. I want to go there as well and hit almost every company I can that is into web development.
						<br>
						<br>So I just got ready and my gosh, tying a tie is one of the most difficult things I have ever done. I used something called the '4 in hand' knot, but that was seriously difficult. Even now, my tie is messed up. The shorter end is longer than the wider end, but I just looped it back in and use a tie clip. It looks normal from the outside, which I guess is what matters anyway. Hopefully it doesn't come down while I'm talking to a recruiter. That would be pretty embarassing. So I have class from 11 to 12 and from 12 to 2, which really sucks because I don't have much time for the career fair. I want to hit a few start ups and try for some bigger companies. I'm probably way out of reach for Google, Microsoft, Facebook; you know, the best companies are the best because they recruit the best. I would like to apply to Microsoft, but I dunno. They might just trash my resume. I saw a Yak yesterday that said 'I hope recruiters at least recycle my resume after they're done looking at it.' That was a really great view to look at the career fair. But now that I think about it, I feel like I don't know much either. I mean I only did a little bit of web development this past summer at State Farm, and some database project (which was actually a prototype). I hope I get something. If I can get one internship at a technical company, I would be very happy. Not so much for being a technical company, but I really want to learn the full stack. I feel that the web will eventually overtake everything (including native applications). We already use the web to contact servers through native apps, so I feel like most of it is already there. The more difficult thing about web is making front-end GUIs (at least that's what I think). I've never worked in a professional environment before, so I could be totally wrong. But that's just how I feel it works out so far.</p>
