						<h2>Successful Morning!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:0.3em;">Friday, Sept 11, 2015</span></h2>
					</header>
					<p>So I finally did it! I went to my internship in the morning! I had to anyway, to make up the hours. But of course, right as I walked out of my apartment, I see that it's been raining outside. Oh well, you can't have everything perfect.
						<br>
						<br>As I was changing the date I noticed that todat was 9/11. The event happened when I was very young, but its presence still deeply affects people today. A moment of silence for all those lost.
						<br>
						<br>I wanted to leave that as a separate paragraph because it was important. But back to blogging. So It's approxmitely 9:43 AM, and I actually woke up around 6:15 AM today. I just stayed in bed until I had enough motivation to get to my inernship.
						<br>
						<br> You'll notice that the paragraphs are getting shorter. It's mostly due to my crazy schedule. I try to post whenever I can (and whenever I remember), but it is what it is. It's about 1:33 AM and I dunno whether to make a new post or just keep it in the same one. I decided the same one because technically my day for "today" has not started yet. Anyway, my friends Haenah and Matt came over today and made brownies for me! Matt even helped clean half my dishes, which I was pretty happy about. I absolutely hate doing dishes, so it's good that was taken care of. Only downside is, my roommate's parents came over today and they wanted to sleep a bit earlier than we were hoping. We went to my apartment lounge and ate there, and I have to clean the bowls for tomorrow (it has brownie fudge in it... what fun?!) I was talking to Shalini again today, and I feel like now I'm just bothering her and stuff. NO, let's discuss something else.
						<br>
						<br> So my friend Sonya sent me a picture message of one of our peers in a group project. Apparently he was sending some weird messages to Sonya. Not weird as in creepy, but weird as in you couldn't even understand what he was saying. Proper English words with improper grammar. He is an international student, so I don't mind as much. But it was still pretty bad. Anyway, we talked about that and she told me about this new place called Chatime. I don't know if it's "Chai + Time" or "Chat + Time". Either way, she recommended that we go there and see how it is. I had heard of the place when it was under construction, but nothing passed that. So I'm definitely willing to check it out! And on that note, I am just about to crash. Good night all!</p>
