					<p>Wow it has been a long time since I've blogged. I can't really blame school or anything else (although school <i>was</i> quite a bit of work. So my finals obviously ended a while ago. I did alright in them, although physics was not too much fun. Anyhow, at least I got it over with. Right now I'm on the bus back to UIUC, but I wanted to talk about break. So, not going to lie, this break was pretty bad. It was boring, and some of my "friends" from high school had a few events and didn't invite me. I didn't take it that much to heart, but it piss me off a little bit. Anyway, the first event was a secret santa event that was planned even before finals. I wasn't too surprised about not being invited to this one. The person who was hosting it wasn't in charge of invites, but the person in charge of invites didn't like me from high school (and I didn't like her much either). My friend who went (one who I'm actually a bit closer with) told me that quite a few people were missing, so I wasn't that concerned with not being invited. I saw the pictures on Facebook and that's actually how I found out. So that's fine, nothing too bad. Person didn't like me, alright. But the second one I kind of took to heart.</p>
					<p>The second one was hosted by a friend of mine. Now I wasn't exactly his best buddy, but we did talk from time to time. And I wanted to know why mostly he didn't invite me, but I never really found out (now that I think about it). His New Years party was a bit more trashy though... Alcohol and teenagers is never a good mix. But still, I would have liked to be invited at least (I do <i>not</i> drink) But still, a couple of my closer friends were invited too, and I don't know why he wouldn't include me in that. Whatever.</p>
					<p>However, for some <i>good</i> news, I did go to Chicago downtown. I went with a small group of friends and we went ice-skating and ate at the Grand Lux Cafe. It's a super nice restaurant near The Water Tower mall on Michigan Avenue. Ice skating was so much fun (and I didn't even fall!) We came there around 12 PM and left pretty late, around 9 or 10 PM. Walking in Chicago can take a while too. The location of Grand Lux is a bit far from the ice rink too, so it was kind of far.</p>
