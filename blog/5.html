						<h2>CS196&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:0.3em;">Tuesday, Sept 01, 2015</span></h2>
					</header>
					<p>Holy crap. It's about 9:21 PM and I'm sitting in the CS196 lecture. I should probably do my CS173 homework, but I would feel awkward leaving in the middle. Anyway, I was assigned the job of signing people onto the website and making sure their ideas were updated on there. That was probably one of the craziest things I've done. There was an army smashed into a small room, and I have to individually make sure they were all taken care of. And what's great is that we had a limited amount of computers for them to use, but they had to get through it within 1 minute. That was a mess, and whatever, I tried to do the best I could. The website probably has a few bugs here and there, but I didn't help develop it, so I don't want to bag on them. It was made in a short time as well, so whatever. Anyway, my day today was pretty normal, with the exception of my sickness.
						<br>
						<br>I had to focus on finishing my CS173 homework, so I cut off the last part. Each "break" essentially means a different time I'm writing something (for future reference). It's about 11:11 PM right now (make a wish!) and I am pretty tired from today. So as I was saying before, my sickness is not helping me at all. I absolutely hate being sick. Not really because I care for my body (I do!), but mostly because it hinders me from learning and concentrating. I want learn all of the content (with the exception of assembly in ECE220).</p>
